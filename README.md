# A Jetpack Compose Multi-Module App 

This Android project is built using Jetpack Compose for the UI, Koin for dependency injection, and Ktor for network communication. It leverages CameraX for capturing images, Room for local data storage, and follows a feature-based hybrid modularization architecture.
