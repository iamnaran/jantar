# A Jetpack Compose Multi-Module App 

This Android project is built using Jetpack Compose for the UI, Koin for dependency injection, and Ktor for network communication. It leverages CameraX for capturing images, Room for local data storage, and follows a feature-based hybrid modularization architecture. With Jetpack Compose's declarative UI and Compose Navigation for seamless screen transitions, the app is designed for scalability and maintainability. The modular architecture allows for independent feature development and testing, ensuring a clean and efficient codebase. This project showcases modern Android development practices with a focus on performance, flexibility, and ease of use.
